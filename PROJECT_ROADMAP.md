**Goal**: Get the basic Backstage backend working properly

**Dependencies**: Start here - foundational work
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

#### Issues to Complete:
1. **#1 - Backend API not responding** (🔴 Critical)
   - All API endpoints failing
   - Blocking all backend functionality

2. **#2 - Fix native dependencies** (🔴 Critical)  
   - isolated-vm and better-sqlite3 build failures
   - Choose approach: #8 (Install build tools) OR #9 (Docker setup)

3. **#3 - GUI Pages returning 404 errors** (🔴 Critical)
   - Frontend routing issues
   - Pages not loading properly

4. **#8 - Install build tools** (🔴 Critical)
   - xcode-select --install
   - npm install -g node-gyp
   - Alternative: Use #9 (Docker)

5. **#9 - Docker-based development** (🟡 High)
   - Alternative to build tools
   - More reliable environment

6. **#10 - Test catalog data loading** (🟡 High)
   - Verify 28 entities load correctly
   - Validate personal infrastructure data

#### Success Criteria:
