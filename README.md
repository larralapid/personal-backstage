# Self Catalog

> A personalized infrastructure management hub built with Backstage for tracking projects, data, workflows, and changelog as a solo developer.

## üéØ Overview

This is a custom Backstage implementation designed for personal use, providing a centralized hub to manage your entire development ecosystem. Unlike traditional Backstage setups focused on large organizations, this configuration is optimized for solo developers who want to track their personal infrastructure, projects, and data in one place.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Project Tracking**: Monitor all your personal projects and their status
- **Data Management**: Track both active content creation and passive data logging
- **Workflow Management**: Backlog system with task prioritization and changelog tracking
- **Template System**: Standardized workflows for common development tasks
