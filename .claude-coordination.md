# Claude Instance Coordination

This file tracks active Claude instances to prevent conflicts.

Before making changes:
1. Check .claude-instances.json
2. Update your instance info
3. Check for conflicts
4. Proceed with changes

Instance Management:
- Update last_activity timestamp
- Reserve branches before creating
- Announce major file changes

## Current Protocol:
- Always `git status` before major operations
- Use timestamped branch names if conflicts arise
- Coordinate on shared files (package.json, README.md)
- Check instance file before committing
